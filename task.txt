Tasks for Analyzing Customer Feedback
Data Preparation

Task 1.1: Import the datasets (customer_feedback_data.csv, customer_metadata_data.csv, product_information_data.csv) into Python using libraries like pandas.
Task 1.2: Inspect and clean the data, addressing any missing or inconsistent values.
Data Merging

Task 2.1: Merge datasets on relevant columns (e.g., Customer_ID in customer metadata with Customer_ID in customer feedback, and Product_ID in product information with Product_ID in customer feedback).
Sentiment Analysis

Task 3.1: Sentiment Distribution Analysis

Analyze the distribution of sentiment labels (Positive, Neutral, Negative) across different feedback types and products.
Task 3.2: Feedback Analysis

Perform natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights from the feedback comments, such as common themes or keywords.
Task 3.3: Customer Demographics Impact

Examine how customer demographics (age, gender, location) influence sentiment and feedback.
Task 3.4: Product/Service Analysis

Assess feedback sentiment related to different products/services and identify trends or issues.
